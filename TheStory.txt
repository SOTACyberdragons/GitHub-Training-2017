Mr. Simons and The Squirrel: A Short Story

Once upon a time, there was a man who convinced the others to call him
Mr. Simons. He was a kind man, especially to those he did not despise. He
was especially kind to the love of his life: The Squirrel.

One day, Mr. Simons found the Squirrel dead. Add example stuff here.
