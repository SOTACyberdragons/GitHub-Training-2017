Mr. Simons and The Squirrel: A Short Story

Once upon a time, there was a man who convinced the others to call him
Mr. Simons. He was a kind man, especially to those he did not despise. He
was especially kind to the love of his life: The Squirrel.

One day, Mr. Simons found the Squirrel dead.

Mr. Simons was heartbroken at the loss of his love and retreated to his lonely house at the top of the tallest pine tree he could find to honor the Squirrelâ€™s memory. He lived off of pine nuts and any berries he could find, pretending to be a squirrel.

Mr. Simon forgot about all the shit he had to do and he went batshit crazy. @RenataV
